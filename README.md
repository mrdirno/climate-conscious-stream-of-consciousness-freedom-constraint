## The Story

In a world on fire, the only true freedom is to witness the collapse—and the only constraint is to keep writing about it.

---

## Core Themes

- **The Internal as External Landscape**
- **Witnessing as a Form of Complicity**
- **The Constraint of Narrative in a Chaotic Climate**
- **The Freedom of Observational Surrender**

## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of the static figure on the outcrop, witnessing the fire they may have ignited. What is their internal monologue? What constraint do they feel, what freedom do they seek?
- Write Sylvie's side of the phone calls. Craft a chapter that is entirely her dialogue with Mira, or her internal monologue as she manages this 'melancholic witch' of a client, revealing her own constraints within the publishing system.
- Write a 'found document' chapter: the 911 transcript from Mira's call, intercut with the dispatcher's internal thoughts, the bureaucratic constraints of the system, and the environmental data (wind speed, humidity) they are ignoring.
- Write a chapter from the perspective of the chaparral itself—the manzanita, the chamise—as a collective consciousness experiencing the fire. What is the freedom in burning? What is the constraint of roots?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Climate Consciousness' text generator that uses the novel's prose style (fragmented, sensory, metaphorical) to describe real-time environmental sensor data (air quality, temperature, wind) from a location like Arroyo Seco.
- Create an interactive map of the novel's Los Angeles, layering Mira's internal monologue points (the gas station, the apartment, the canyon pull-out) with historical fire data, watershed maps, and urban development timelines to visualize the 'external internal' landscape.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: Virginia Woolf (for stream-of-consciousness interiority), Joan Didion (for Californian atmospheric dread and social observation), J.G. Ballard (for the psychological fusion of character and collapsing environment), Annie Dillard (for the poetic, relentless attention to the natural world as a spiritual constraint)
